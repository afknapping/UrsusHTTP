# Ursus

An Urbit HTTP client for iOS in Swift.

- [`%eyre` specification](http://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/eyre/specification/)

## Usage

Ursus is very much a work in progress. For now, it only supports authentication with your planet.

First, you need to set the `baseURL` on the Ursus client to the URL your planet is being served on. This might be something like `"https://pittyp-pittyp.urbit.org"` or `"http://localhost:8080"`. 

```swift
Ursus.baseURL = "https://pittyp-pittyp.urbit.org"
```

Then, we can request an Auth object and sign in, using your ship's name and code (you can print out the code in dojo, using `+code`).

```swift
let ship = "pittyp-pittyp"
let code = "xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx"

Ursus.GETAuth().then { auth -> Promise<Auth> in
    return Ursus.PUTAuth(oryx: auth.oryx!, ship: ship, code: code)
}.then { auth in
    self.auth = auth // Save the authentication object somewhere
    print("Signed in successfully")
}.error { error in
    print("Something went wrong", error.localizedDescription)
}
```

Easy! Signing out is about as simple:

```swift
let ship = "pittyp-pittyp"
let oryx = self.auth!.oryx!

Ursus.DELETEAuth(oryx: oryx, ship: ship).then { auth in
    self.auth = nil // Throw away our authentication object
    print("Signed out successfully")
}.error { error in
    print("Something went wrong", error.localizedDescription)
}
```

## Demo application

There is a demo application in the `Ursus Demo` folder. You will need to open `AppDelegate.swift` and make sure `Ursus.baseURL` is set.

## Cocoapods

Ursus can be installed by adding `pod 'Ursus', '~> 0.1'` to your `Podfile`.

I can set up Carthage support if you need it.

## Next steps/goals/ideas

- Set up [messaging](http://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/eyre/specification/#-1-4-messaging) and [subscriptions](http://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/eyre/specification/#-1-5-subscriptions)

- Talking to the [`%click` example app](https://github.com/urbit/examples/tree/master/gall/click) might be a good start...?

- Persistent authorization (using SSKeychain/SAMKeychain)

- Generalised support for phonetic base strings (perhaps object that conforms to `StringLiteralConvertible`, enum for galaxies, stars etc)

- Easy specification of ship/event/desk when making a request

- Mark specification

- Clean usage of `/~/as`, `/~/am`, `/~/to`, `/~/of` etc
